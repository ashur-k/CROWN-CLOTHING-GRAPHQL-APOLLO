# My Experience and what I learn:
In this lesson I learn about setting up graphql and apollo in a react project. First I had forked and clone starting part of lesson (provided by Udemy). Then wrote context codes while watching video. Cloning and installing repo was challenge. There were issues with node-sass and react-scripts and react versions. Solving version issues was challenging but helped me to know about node version manager, package.json file, differences between dependencies and dev dependencies. I find out some differences between time npm and yarn. Overall once all these problems were solve I really enjoyed writing grraphql apollo and had learned a great deal.
